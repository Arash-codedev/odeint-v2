<p>Here, we collect some statements of satisfied users
  of <strong>odeint</strong>.
  If you also happily use our library you are welcome to send us your
  opinion. Of course, we are even more interested in any problems you encounter
  so we can try to fix it and make <strong>odeint</strong> even better - just
  open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/headmyshoulder/odeint-v2/" target="_blank">github</a>.

<p>One of the largest problems I came up against when working with C or Fortran 
was the lack of useful integrators. Obviously integrators are available, but I 
found myself jumping through hoops. In the case of C, I was using the GSL 
library, which both defines its own complex type (C has had its own since C99) 
and then fails to use it for the integrator routines, necessitating the 
doubling of the size of the system. That's not all that difficult in practise, 
but it's a an additional layer in the code that doesn't help readability. 
Worse, the routines rely on arcane drivers which means cracking out the 
manual, which is also unhelpful. In the case of Fortran, the VODE integrators 
are good, but require your program to be arranged in a particular way. Not so 
good for plug and play ODE solving.

Recently I came across the C++ odeint library. I was so impressed by its 
flexibility that I actually started using C++ (having had no prior experience) 
just for the convenience of it. I'm glad that I did this, because C++ has some 
other very useful features that make solving quantum mechanical systems 
simpler. Probably the most important feature that I use (perhaps abuse) is 
functors, a kind class with which instances can be used as functions.</p></div>

<p>I am impressed of the design.
To say the big things first, I am impressed by the possibility to use CUDA
and OpenCL for parallel computation of various ODE types in a simple manner.
The simple and straight forward interface allowed an immediate usage of the
library.
This library is also made for a versatile usage due to the many algorithms
(steppers) implemented. I can e.g. try different numerical approaches und
compare the outcome or the performance.
The performance during simulation is optimal, and outperforms most standard
libraries (e.g. GSL).
I also appreciate the modern C++ style (STL), in comparison to GSL which is
more C oriented.</p></div>

<p>First of all, I just found your excellent library odeint-v2. I really 
like your approach to the design of the library. I was just thinking of 
trying to write something like this for a project I was doing, but 
luckily you already did it.</p></div>
