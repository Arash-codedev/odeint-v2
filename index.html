<strong>Odeint</strong> is a modern C++ library for numerically solving Ordinary Differential Equations. It is developed in a generic way using Template Metaprogramming which leads to extraordinary high flexibility at top performance. The numerical algorithms are implemented independently of the underlying arithmetics. This results in an incredible applicability of the library, especially in non-standard environments. For example, odeint supports matrix types, arbitrary precision arithmetics and even can be easily run on CUDA GPUs - check the <a href="highlights.html">Highlights</a> to learn more. <br/><br/>
Moreover, <strong>odeint</strong> provides a comfortable easy-to-use interface allowing for a quick and efficient implementation of numerical simulations. Visit the impressively clear 30 lines <a href="examples.html#lorenzsystem">Lorenz example</a>.<br/><br/>
<strong>Odeint</strong> is a header only C++ library and the full source code is available for <a href="downloads.html">download.</a> distributed under the highly liberal <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/license.html" target="_blank"> Boost Software License</a>. Hence, <strong>odeint</strong> is free, open source and can be used in both non-commercial and commercial applications.

<h1>boostified</h1>

<p><strong>odeint</strong> did undergo the <a href="http://www.boost.org/community/reviews.html" target="_blank">boost
    review process</a> in the end of September 2012, which means users and
  other library authors evaluate the 
  code and provide a review report. Based on these
  reports, <strong>odeint</strong> <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.boost.devel/234694" target="_blank">was accepted</a>
  and thus will become part of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/"
                                      target="_blank">boost library
    collection</a>. That means <strong>odeint</strong> will be officially
  shipped with one of the next releases of boost!
</p>
<p>Thanks to Steven Watanabe for managing the review and to everyone who
  participated by providing comments or even a whole review report. We are very
  proud to contribute a high quality, modern and stable numerical library into
  boost.
