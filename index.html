<strong>Odeint</strong> is a modern C++ library for numerically solving Ordinary Differential Equations. It is developed in a generic way using Template Metaprogramming which leads to extraordinary high flexibility at top performance. The numerical algorithms are implemented independently of the underlying arithmetics. This results in an incredible applicability of the library, especially in non-standard environments. For example, odeint supports matrix types, arbitrary precision arithmetics and even can be easily run on CUDA GPUs - check the <a href="highlights.html">Highlights</a> to learn more. <br/><br/>
Moreover, <strong>odeint</strong> provides a comfortable easy-to-use interface allowing for a quick and efficient implementation of numerical simulations. Visit the impressively clear 30 lines <a href="examples.html#lorenzsystem">Lorenz example</a>.<br/><br/>
<strong>Odeint</strong> is a header only C++ library and the full source code is available for <a href="downloads.html">download.</a> distributed under the highly liberal <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/license.html" target="_blank"> Boost Software License</a>. Hence, <strong>odeint</strong> is free, open source and can be used in both non-commercial and commercial applications.

<h1>meet us</h1>

<p>We will be attending this years <a href="http://cppnow.org/" target="_blank">CppNow! Conference</a> (aka BoostCon) held May 13-18, 2012, in Aspen Colorado where we are going to give an overview talk on <strong>odeint</strong>.
We would be happy to meet and discuss with anyone who has interest in this library there, of course.
